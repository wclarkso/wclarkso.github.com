                            Fill-in-the-bubble forms are widely used for surveys, election ballots, and standardized tests. In these and other scenarios, use of the forms comes with an implicit assumption that individuals bubble markings themselves are not identifying. This work challenges this assumption, demonstrating that fill-in-the-bubble forms could convey a respondent's identity even in the absence of explicit identifying information. We develop methods to capture the unique features of a marked bubble and use machine learning to isolate characteristics indicative of its creator. Using surveys from more than ninety individuals, we apply these techniques and successfully re-identify individuals from markings alone with over 50% accuracy. <br />This bubble-based analysis can have either positive or negative implications depending on the application. Potential applications range from detection of cheating on standardized tests to attacks on the secrecy of election ballots. To protect against negative consequences, we discuss mitigation techniques to remove a bubble's identifying characteristics. We suggest additional tests using longitudinal data and larger datasets to further explore the potential of our approach in real-world applications.

                            Recent research has demonstrated that individual pieces of paper can be fingerprinted and reidentified later at low cost, using commodity scanners. We consider the conse- quences of this fact for electronic voting. The most ob- vious consequence is negative: the ability to fingerprint paper endangers the secrecy of ballots in any system that keeps paper records of individual ballots, including stan- dard optical scan and DRE-VVPAT systems. We char- acterize the resulting risks and discuss when and how they can be mitigated. Less obviously, the ability to fin- gerprint paper can also have positive consequences, by enabling certain new kinds of post-election audit proce- dures, both to compare electronic records to the corre- sponding paper records and to detect the use of forged ballot stock. Paper reidentification presents new chal- lenges for election officials, but careful consideration of its implications now may allow us to preserve ballot se- crecy and strengthen election integrity.

                            This paper presents a novel technique for authenticating physical  documents based on random, naturally occurring imperfections in  paper texture. We introduce a new method for measuring the  three-dimensional surface of a page using only a commodity scanner  and without modifying the document in any way. From this physical  feature, we generate a concise fingerprint that uniquely identifies  the document. Our technique is secure against counterfeiting and  robust to harsh handling; it can be used even before any content  is printed on a page. It has a wide range of applications, including  detecting forged currency and tickets, authenticating passports, and  halting counterfeit goods. Document identification could also be  applied maliciously to de-anonymize printed surveys and to  compromise the secrecy of paper ballots.

                            Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers  retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost,  even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a  motherboard. Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not  refreshed, they are not immediately erased, and their contents  persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of  usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon  limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic  key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold  reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems —  BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt — using no special  devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and  predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times  can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new  algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for  correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several  strategies for partially mitigating these risks, we know of no  simple remedy that would eliminate them.
