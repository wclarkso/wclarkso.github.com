I'm William (Will) Clarkson, a Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at Princeton University. I'm a member of the [Security Group](http://security.cs.princeton.edu) and the [Center for Information Technology Policy](http://citp.princeton.edu). My advisor is [Ed Felten](http://cs.princeton.edu/~felten/). My (professional) interests range from applied cryptography and biometrics to privacy and information technology policy more generally. In recent years, my research has centered around identifying ostensibly identical or anonymous items that exhibit identifying features.
