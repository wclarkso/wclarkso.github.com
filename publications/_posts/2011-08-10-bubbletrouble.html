abstract: > 
    Fill-in-the-bubble forms are widely used for surveys, election ballots, and standardized tests. In these and other scenarios, use of the
    forms comes with an implicit assumption that individuals bubble markings themselves are not identifying. This work challenges this
    assumption, demonstrating that fill-in-the-bubble forms could convey a respondent's identity even in the absence of explicit identifying
    information. We develop methods to capture the unique features of a marked bubble and use machine learning to isolate characteristics
    indicative of its creator. Using surveys from more than ninety individuals, we apply these techniques and successfully re-identify
    individuals from markings alone with over 50% accuracy. <br>This bubble-based analysis can have either positive or negative implications
    depending on the application. Potential applications range from detection of cheating on standardized tests to attacks on the secrecy of
    election ballots. To protect against negative consequences, we discuss mitigation techniques to remove a bubble's identifying
    characteristics. We suggest additional tests using longitudinal data and larger datasets to further explore the potential of our
    approach in real-world applications.
