abstract: > 
    Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers 
    retain their contents for seconds to minutes after power is lost, 
    even at operating temperatures and even if removed from a 
    motherboard. Although DRAMs become less reliable when they are not 
    refreshed, they are not immediately erased, and their contents 
    persist sufficiently for malicious (or forensic) acquisition of 
    usable full-system memory images. We show that this phenomenon 
    limits the ability of an operating system to protect cryptographic 
    key material from an attacker with physical access. We use cold 
    reboots to mount attacks on popular disk encryption systems — 
    BitLocker, FileVault, dm-crypt, and TrueCrypt — using no special 
    devices or materials. We experimentally characterize the extent and 
    predictability of memory remanence and report that remanence times 
    can be increased dramatically with simple techniques. We offer new 
    algorithms for finding cryptographic keys in memory images and for 
    correcting errors caused by bit decay. Though we discuss several 
    strategies for partially mitigating these risks, we know of no 
    simple remedy that would eliminate them.
