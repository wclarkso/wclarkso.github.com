abstract: > 
    This paper presents a novel technique for authenticating physical 
    documents based on random, naturally occurring imperfections in 
    paper texture. We introduce a new method for measuring the 
    three-dimensional surface of a page using only a commodity scanner 
    and without modifying the document in any way. From this physical 
    feature, we generate a concise fingerprint that uniquely identifies 
    the document. Our technique is secure against counterfeiting and 
    robust to harsh handling; it can be used even before any content 
    is printed on a page. It has a wide range of applications, including 
    detecting forged currency and tickets, authenticating passports, and 
    halting counterfeit goods. Document identification could also be 
    applied maliciously to de-anonymize printed surveys and to 
    compromise the secrecy of paper ballots.
