abstract: > 
    Recent research has demonstrated that individual pieces of paper can be fingerprinted and reidentified later at low cost, using commodity scanners. We consider the conse- quences of this fact for electronic voting. The most ob- vious consequence is negative: the ability to fingerprint paper endangers the secrecy of ballots in any system that keeps paper records of individual ballots, including stan- dard optical scan and DRE-VVPAT systems. We char- acterize the resulting risks and discuss when and how they can be mitigated. Less obviously, the ability to fin- gerprint paper can also have positive consequences, by enabling certain new kinds of post-election audit proce- dures, both to compare electronic records to the corre- sponding paper records and to detect the use of forged ballot stock. Paper reidentification presents new chal- lenges for election officials, but careful consideration of its implications now may allow us to preserve ballot se- crecy and strengthen election integrity.
